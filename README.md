# Real-Time-Optical-Character-Recognition
This project involves the development of a real-time Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system using Tesseract, OpenCV, and machine learning algorithms. The system is capable of accurately extracting text from various types of documents and images.

## Overview

This project was developed during a six-week summer internship at GAIL (India) Ltd. The primary objective was to create a robust OCR system that can preprocess images, reduce noise, and accurately convert them into machine-readable text.


## Features
- Real-time OCR processing
- Image preprocessing (noise reduction, thresholding, edge detection)
- Integration of machine learning models to enhance OCR accuracy


## Technologies Used
- Tesseract
- OpenCV
- Python


## Prerequisites 
- **Tesseract installed:**
  Install tesseract from [Tesseract at UB Mannheim](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)
